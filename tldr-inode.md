TL;DR:

An inode is a data structure on a filesystem on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that stores all the information about a file except its name and its actual data. 

DevOps Pro Tip:

If you're worried about inodes, you care too much about your instance/container/pod. They are cattle, not pets.
