Here are a few of my favorite commands when my automation fails and I'm forced to actually log into a linux instance.

#Because it seems like I'm always troubleshooting EMR's Jupyter container

docker exec -it jupyterhub /bin/bash 

#Because I would like to know if it is at least running
docker stats

#because I can quickly see who is misbehaving
top

#Because I need to find a file of a certain pattern under the current directory, but not too far
find . -maxdepth 2 -name *.conf

#Because I need to verify Ansible formatted and mounted attached volumes correctly
lsblk -fs

#because I hate it when I run out of space on the root volume (because somebody else didn't automate mounting /var/log to a secondary volume)
df -h

#because this data scientist keeps breaking jupyterhub and I need to know that they did
cat /var/log/jupyter/jupyter.log | grep yeahthatguyagain

#check to see what processes are using conda
ps aux | grep conda
